# How to Save Progress
In this program we are saving the number of times that a web page has been loaded, but we could use the same technique to store any kind of progress (progress of a game for example). Processing offers two functions that allow you to read and write to a file [`loadStrings`](https://processing.org/reference/loadStrings_.html) and [`saveStrings`](https://processing.org/reference/saveStrings_.html). In this program we are reading and writing to a text file called `progress.txt`. The first time a user visits the page, we load the number 1 from `progress.txt` and display it to the screen. Then we increment the counter and save the increased value using `saveStrings`.   

When we save the increased value, it is stored in the users web browser cache, not in the `progress.txt` on the website. This is called *HTML storage* or *Web storage*. This means that each users progress will be saved independently of any other users. Note that the size of the stored data is limited to 5Mb.
